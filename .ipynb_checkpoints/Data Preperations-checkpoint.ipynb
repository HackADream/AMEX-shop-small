    "This code will generate two CSV data. One CSV data is named as \"user_rating.csv\". It contains 500 unique users with their ratings on the items they bought. The rating score ranges from 1 to 10. Another is called \"list_items.csv\". It contains 500 unique items, its postcode and price. Our goal of the prediction is to predict the ratings that each user will give to the items they have not bought. We generate random 10 postcodes which will be randomly assigned to each items. We are not generating random postcodes for each items as it will take too much of time."
